# DS-Projects

Collection of projects focused on honing our skills and applying what we learned in Data-Structure

Project 1: Statistician Class, a project that reinforces the concept of a small bag class. 

Project 2: Sequence Class, implement and test a sequence class using an arrayto store the sequence's elements. 

Project 3: Sequence-Dynamic, revisited sequence class using a dynamic array to store more elements. 

Project 4: Linked-List, implemented and test a revised sequence class that uses a linked list to store elements. 

Project 5: Recursion, implemented and test four short recursive functions, with the use of proper recursion, none of these functions should require more than a dozen lines of code. 

Project 6: Binary Tree, implemented the bag template file utilizing functions provided using binary tree to store elements.
